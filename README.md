# AngryPigs

Almost everyone played the famous mobile game Angry Bird. Player had to kill some pigs and pass levels in the game. Score was given according to how brutally you can kill the pigs!
If you know the story behind the game, you might know that the pigs once theft some of the eggs from the birds, that's why the birds are angry and started killing them.

But, do you think that the pigs did something this much worse, that they should die for it? Don't you eat eggs? Don't you eat meats? Don't you eat fish?

So, stand against the birds,stand beside the pigs. They are being tortured a lot. Save them! Or, they'll get killed only for collecting some foods. And see the twists!
